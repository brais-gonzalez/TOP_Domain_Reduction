# TOP_Domain_Reduction

This repository contains the data obtained executing RAPOSa (raposa.usc.es) used to generate the tables in the paper "Impact of domain reduction techniques in polynomial optimization: A computational study" (a preliminary draft can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02823 and soon in the journal TOP).

Each folder is named with the option used to run RAPOSa, and within each folder are the results for each problem (the name of each file corresponds to the name of the problem.
